    """Generate time series using the Mackey-Glass equation.

    Generates time series using the discrete approximation of the
    Mackey-Glass delay differential equation described by Grassberger &
    Procaccia (1983).

    Parameters
    ----------
    length : int
        Length of the time series.
    x0 : array
        Initial condition (lenght = n).
    a : float
        Constant.
    b : float
        Constant.
    c : float
        Constant.
    tau : float
        Time delay.
    n : int
        The number of discrete steps into which the interval between
        t and t + tau should be divided.  This results in a time
        step of tau/n and an n + 1 dimensional map.
    sample : float
        Sampling step of the time series.  It is useful to pick
        something between tau/100 and tau/10, with tau/sample being
        a factor of n.  This will make sure that there are only whole
        number indices.
    discard : int
        Number of n-steps to discard in order to eliminate transients.
        A total of n*discard steps will be discarded.

    Returns
    -------
    x : array
        Array containing the time series.
